Application Architecture
Frontend (React.js):

Components: Dashboard, Login/Signup, Language Selection, Progress Tracker, Lesson Viewer, etc.
State Management: React Context API for global state (user authentication, selected language, progress).
Routes: React Router for navigation between different views.
API calls: Axios for interacting with backend REST APIs.
Backend (Node.js + Express.js):

Controllers: Handle requests and business logic.
Routes: Define API endpoints for authentication, learning materials, assessments, progress tracking.
Services: Abstract the logic for interacting with the database.
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for securing user sessions.
Database: MongoDB (NoSQL) to store user data, lessons, assessments, and progress.
Database Schema (MongoDB):

Users:

json
Copy code
{
  "user_id": ObjectId,
  "name": String,
  "email": String,
  "password": String (hashed),
  "role": String (learner/admin),
  "selected_language": String,
  "progress": [ObjectId (Progress)]
}
Languages:

json
Copy code
{
  "language_id": ObjectId,
  "name": String,
  "lessons": [ObjectId (Lesson)],
  "assessments": [ObjectId (Assessment)]
}
Lessons:

json
Copy code
{
  "lesson_id": ObjectId,
  "title": String,
  "content": String,
  "media_type": String (audio/video/text),
  "associated_language_id": ObjectId
}
Assessments:

json
Copy code
{
  "assessment_id": ObjectId,
  "language_id": ObjectId,
  "questions": [
    {
      "question_id": ObjectId,
      "question_text": String,
      "options": [String],
      "correct_answer": String
    }
  ],
  "feedback": String
}
Progress:

json
Copy code
{
  "user_id": ObjectId,
  "language_id": ObjectId,
  "completed_lessons": [ObjectId (Lesson)],
  "test_scores": [ObjectId (Assessment)],
  "completion_percentage": Number
}
UI/UX Wireframes:
Create wireframes for the following pages using a tool like Figma or Adobe XD:

Login/Signup Page: Forms for entering email and password, and links to reset the password.
Dashboard: Displays user progress, selected language, and buttons for selecting lessons or assessments.
Lesson Viewer: Interface for viewing lessons (text, images, audio players).
Progress Tracker: Graphs and charts that show how far the user has come in their learning.
You can create wireframes that look like this:

Login/Signup Page

A simple form with fields for Email, Password, and Submit button.
Dashboard Page

Display the user's progress and selected language with an option to select new languages.
Button to browse lessons or take an assessment.
Progress Tracker

A visual representation (chart) of lesson completion and test scores.
Progress bar or pie chart for percentage completion.
